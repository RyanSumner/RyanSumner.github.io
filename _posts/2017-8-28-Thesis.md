Translating the fancy academic language into plain english, 
my Master's Thesis looks at using some camera rotation in Virtual Reality to mimic the eye rotation that we use with our human eyes when we look at something very close to us.

From previous research, we know that viewing close things is a problem in virtual reality, the camera rotation solution aims to help with this.
The solution was built and tested using the Unity3D game engine with the Oculus DK2 and programmed in C#.
