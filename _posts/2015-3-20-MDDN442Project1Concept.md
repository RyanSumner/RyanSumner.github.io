title: MDDN442 Project 1 Concept - Time Dilation
---
My concept for this project is to create a human interactive application that will educate the user about Time Dilation. 
This would include Time Dilation's small impacts in every day life (such as GPS) and to abstract it in terms of the bigger picture in regards to space, time and the speed of light (for example: how fast would you need to go in order to slow down time to half its normal rate).

This would involve coming up with mostly interactive scenarios to educate the user via showing them Time Dilation rather than just telling them about it.

One such scenario:
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Time Dilation.png)
Two light based clocks, one stationary, one in motion.
Time Dilation is affecting the clock in motion, the clock seems slower relative to the clock that is stationary.

The application would also involve the user being able to have control over certain variables (using buttons or sliders) such as the speed of an object(s) and therefore seeing the consequences it would produce in terms of time being speed up or slowed down relative to the user.

Inserting more objects into a scenario and switching between perspectives (in terms of time) may also be an option.

The application would be initially built for the PC in Touch Designer, building for other platforms may be a consideration after the initial development.
