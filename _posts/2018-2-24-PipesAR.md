This demo shows off one possible application of AR using the Hololens, the ability to see addition information beyond walls via holograms.

This demo required some alignment with the room, which was done using input from the user by aligning some virtual spheres.

Using the positions of the virtual spheres as input, some vector calculations were done to find the correct orientation and position of the pipes relative to the user.

The pipes themselves were placed in the scene using Unity3D.

Note: The video above doesn't showcase the depth you perceive when you are actually wearing the Hololens.
