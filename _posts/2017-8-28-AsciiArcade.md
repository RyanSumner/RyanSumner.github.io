This was a Group Project I contributed to during University, so I can only claim partial credit. 
Ascii Arcade is a small game programmed in Python that is rendered using a custom shader that renders everything with appropriate ascii characters.

My contritribution to this project was the modelling of all the meshes (2 spaceships, a butch of asteroids and some projectiles), and the implementation of the highscore screen.

The main game itself was programmed by Josh Clarkson and the ascii shader was made by Ben Allen.
