title: A Basic Renderer written in Java
---

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BasicRenderer/BigBoxes.png)

This was an assignment at university written in java that that uses a parser that can save and load mesh data from a .txt file.
Then the mesh data is rendered via a number of algorithms from the rendering pipeline.

Then there are addition options via the UI of the application of rotating the mesh and changing a number of lighting options. 

Two of the java files were originally provided by the university, which were Vector3D.java and Transform.java. I wrote the rest of the code.

The source files, class files and the executable jar file with example model data can be found [here](../downloads/BasicRenderer.zip)
