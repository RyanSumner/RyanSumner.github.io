### About Me

I want to be a programmer. I am especially interested in creating games and other experiences. I am also interested in working with virtual reality due to completing my Master’s Thesis on a topic related to it.
 
Like many, I grew up playing computer games, and whilst I found playing games thoroughly enjoyable, my fascination coupled with my enquiring mind and creative thinking led me to want to understand behind the scenes of the entire gaming creation process, so following the completion of my first computer science degree from Massey University, I signed up for and completed a Master’s degree in computer graphics at Victoria University.
 
Most recently, I have been fortunate enough to play around with head-mounted displays (such as the Oculus Rift and UTC Vive). This was due to virtual reality being the topic of my final year of my Master’s through the completion of a Thesis. My Thesis titled: “The Impact of Dynamic Convergence on the Human Visual System in Head-Mounted Displays” looks into a method to ease visual discomfort when viewing close virtual objects in virtual reality.
 
I am originally from the UK, I’ve been in New Zealand since 2008, initially in Auckland for five years before moving to Wellington in 2013. My passion for problem solving became apparent at school where I excelled in science and mathematics, this in turn led to an interest in all things technology and thus programming. This was the basis for my decision to take a degree in computer science to set the stage for a career in programming.
 
I have been educated in both programming and designer skillsets, proficient with C++, Java and Python with the ability to pick up other programming languages quickly. Having also worked extensively with Maya for both programming and modeling and Unity3D for developing various projects. Furthermore, my background in maths and algorithms has been invaluable when creating solutions for a wide range of problems. I take great pride in seeing all work and projects through to completion (as seen by completing a Masters), this coupled with my technical and soft skills, I believe will be of tremendous value to any employer.
